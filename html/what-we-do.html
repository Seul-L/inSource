Throughout the implementation the InSource team will keep in contact with the project team at the organization to make sure the project is running smoothly.<br><br> The Follow-up process is one of the most important parts of the InSource process - it allows all Members to be engaged in the solution regardless of their participation in the Sprint Workshop and also provides that bridge between the proposed solution and the actual outcome.</div>
