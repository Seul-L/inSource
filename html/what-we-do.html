          is one of the most important parts of the inSource process - it allows all members to be engaged, regardless of their participation in the Sprint Workshop and also provides insight into the proposed solution and the actual outcome.</div>

      <div class="text-block-2">By using the inSource platform, organizations can directly engage their employees by discovering what issues and concerns they are facing. From there, the organization has the ability to empower their employees to solve those exact problems they
        feel are important. Employees will not only feel more engaged and supported by their employers, but employers are able to rapidly solve organizational challenges. Solutions which will have a direct impact for the organization. Who better to solve
        your organization’s issues than people within your organization? Why outsource when you can inSource!</div>
